## Flint Loader Project

### NOTICE
This project is simply a hobby project and not intended to replace Forge, Fabric or Quilt. It may or may not be kept up to date, so you use it entirely at your own risk. Bug reports and feature requests are welcome

***

### What is this

Flint Loader is an attempt at a Modern, CLIENT SIDE only mod loader, intended to be used when playing on vanilla or non-modded servers. Kinda like what LiteLoader used to be.

### Disclosure

This project makes use of modified Fabric Components like Loom and the Fabric Loader/Mappings. These versions have been modified for this loader and will NOT work with fabric at all.
Changes are listed in the readme of each project. This project is not affiliated with, or endorced by Mojang or FabricMC.

#### Notice to any fabric devs that may see this

We do not intend to replace, or compete with you. This is something I started because of boredom and wanting to try something different. 
We also mirror any fabric libraries that we use (from maven.fabricmc.net) to our own maven, so that we don't cause extra load or expenses for your infrastructure. Thank you for your hard work you put in, making this project possible
