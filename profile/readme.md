## Flint Loader Project

<h1 class='font-bold text-2xl mb-2'>What is this?</h1>

<p>
  Flint is a tiny, open-source modloader system, aimed at players playing on Vanilla and Plugin Servers, like Spigot/Paper etc. This is <b>NOT</b> a replacement for Fabric, Quilt, NeoForge or Forge, and will not allow you to run mods made for any of them. Flint has it's own API for mods. <br /><br />
            Flint is a hobby/learning project, and is not intended to replace any other modloader out there, and will not allow you to run a server. If you feel this project is stupid and should die, don't use it. Better modloaders with better mods exist. <br /><br />
            If there is ever enough interest in this project, it will be continuously developed and improved on, and may possibly get a compatibility layer for SOME fabric client side mods. <br /><br />

Any developers potentially interested in developing for this loader, you are free to do so, and can ask for help in our Discord. You can also check out the <a href='https://github.com/Flintloader-Modules'>UNOFFICIAL DEMO MODULES</a> repository for some insight into how flint development works.

### Disclosure

This project makes use of modified Fabric Components like Loom and the Fabric Loader/Mappings. These versions have been modified for this loader and will NOT work with fabric at all.
Changes are listed in the readme of each project. This project is not affiliated with, or endorsed by Mojang or FabricMC.

#### Notice to any fabric devs that may see this

We do not intend to replace, or compete with you. This is something I started because of boredom and wanting to try something different. 
We also mirror any fabric libraries that we use (from maven.fabricmc.net) to our own maven, so that we don't cause extra load or expenses for your infrastructure. Thank you for your hard work you put in, making this project possible
